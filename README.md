## Description

You want to easily keep track on your expenses? That's what Spendator is for! In addition, the app shows you how to become a smart consumer with useful tips.

Spendator was developed as my capstone project during the final four weeks of the neuefische Web Development Bootcamp.

This app is optimized for mobile usage, so please switch your browser to responsive mode.
